    "description": "An ospfNbrStateChange trap signifies that there has been a change in the state of a non- virtual OSPF neighbor. This trap should be generated when the neighbor state regresses (e.g., goes from Attempt or Full to 1-Way or Down) or progresses to a terminal state (e.g., 2-Way or Full). When an neighbor transitions from or to Full on non-broadcast multi-access and broadcast networks, the trap should be gen- erated by the designated router. A designated router transitioning to Down will be noted by ospfIfStateChange.",

# E203 whitespace before ':'
#    Conflicts with black formatting
# E402 module level import not at top of file
#    Imports may be at the end of module to resolve circular references
# E501 line too long
#    Not a real bug
# F403 from xxx import *' used; unable to detect undefined names
#    Needs global refactoring, postponed for a while
# F405 'xxx' may be undefined, or defined from star imports: xxx
#    Needs global refactoring, postponed for a while
# W503 line break before binary operator
#    Not PEP8 compliant
# W605 invalid escape sequence 'x'
#    As of Python 3.6, a backslash-character pair that is
#    not a valid escape sequence now generates a DeprecationWarning.
#    Although this will eventually become a SyntaxError,
#    that will not be for several Python releases.
#    Not an actual error for Python2 and breaks already passed tests.
#    Postponed for a while
